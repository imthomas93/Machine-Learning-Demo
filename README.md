## Decision Tree for Equine Colic Diagnosis

Equine colic is one of the leading causes of death in adult horses (https://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Horse_colic). However, if diagnosed early enough, it is often surgically curable. Part 1 of this project is to developed a decision tree algorithm that will learn to diagnose whether a patient is healthy or has colic. This example will use a total of 16 attributes to distrubte the decision tree.


## Decision Tree for Math Studentâ€™s Performance

Second part of this project is to identify the demographic characteristics of students that are likely to fail a math exam using a total of 28 attributes.
